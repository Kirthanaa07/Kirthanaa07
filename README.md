### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a dedicated stay-at-home mom, I embarked on an inspiring journey to fulfill my passion for technology and software development. Armed with a Master of Computer Application (MCA) degree and having previously contributed two years as an Associate Engineer at Virtusa Hyderabad, I decided to pivot my career. My experience in production support equipped me with valuable problem-solving and technical skills, which I am now eager to leverage in the field of software development. This transition represents not only my commitment to personal and professional growth but also my unwavering dedication to providing the best opportunities for my family. With a foundation in engineering, a love for coding, and a strong work ethic, I am excited to embark on this new chapter as I strive to become a successful software developer.
